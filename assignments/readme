Assignments: Regular Expressions and Text Preprocessing

1. Create a Python program that reads a text file and prints all the email
addresses found in the file using regular expressions. Extend the program to
extract and print domain names of the email addresses found.

2. Write a Python program that reads a text file containing a list of phone
numbers in various formats (e.g., (123) 456-7890, 123-456-7890,
123.456.7890) and converts them to a standardized format (e.g., 1234567890)
using regular expressions. Handle country codes and different variations of
phone number formats.

3. Develop a Python script that extracts all the URLs from a given HTML
document using regular expressions.

4. Write a Python program that extracts all the hashtags from a given tweet
using regular expressions.

5. Collect a research paper containing texts from a specific domain (e.g., medical,
legal, technical). Apply stemming and lemmatization to this domain-specific
text and analyze how it differs from processing general-purpose text.

6. Develop an interactive Python application using Tkinter or PyQt that allows
users to input text and view the stemmed or lemmatized output along with
the original words.

7. Write a Python script that continuously monitors a text stream (e.g., news
articles from RSS feeds) and performs stemming and lemmatization on new
incoming texts in real-time. Display the processed text along with some
statistics (e.g., most common stems or lemmas).
