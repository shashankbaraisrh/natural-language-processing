Text Processing and Regular Expressions Assignments

Email Extraction and Domain Extraction:

Task: Extracts and prints all email addresses from a text file, and then extracts and prints the domain names from those email addresses.
Usage: Reads a text file, uses regular expressions to find email addresses, and parses the domain names.

Phone Number Standardization:

Task: Converts various phone number formats to a standardized format (1234567890) using regular expressions.
Usage: Reads a text file with phone numbers, handles different formats and country codes, and outputs standardized phone numbers.
URL Extraction from HTML:

Task: Extracts all URLs from a given HTML document using regular expressions.
Usage: Reads an HTML document and uses regular expressions to find and print all URLs.

Hashtag Extraction from Tweets:

Task: Extracts all hashtags from a given tweet using regular expressions.
Usage: Processes a tweet and identifies all hashtags present.

Domain-Specific Text Processing:

Task: Applies stemming and lemmatization to domain-specific text (e.g., medical, legal, technical) and compares it with general-purpose text processing.
Usage: Analyzes a research paper and demonstrates differences in text preprocessing techniques.

Interactive Text Processing Application:

Task: Provides an interactive interface using Tkinter or PyQt for users to input text and view stemmed or lemmatized output alongside the original words.
Usage: Allows users to see the effects of stemming and lemmatization on input text through a GUI.

Real-time Text Stream Processing:

Task: Monitors a continuous text stream (e.g., news RSS feeds) and performs real-time stemming and lemmatization, displaying processed text and statistics.
Usage: Continuously processes incoming text, updates statistics, and provides insights into the most common stems or lemmas.
