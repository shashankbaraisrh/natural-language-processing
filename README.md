Welcome to my Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects repository! This collection showcases various NLP projects I have worked on, demonstrating a range of techniques and applications in the field of text analysis and processing. Each project is contained within its own directory, complete with relevant code, data, and documentation.

Project Overview

1. Chatbot Project
   
Description: This project involves creating an interactive chatbot that can understand and respond to user queries. The chatbot utilizes NLP techniques to interpret user input and generate appropriate responses.
Key Technologies: Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Natural Language Generation (NLG), Dialog Management, Python, TensorFlow.

2. Movies Recommendation
   
Description: A movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. The project leverages NLP to analyze movie descriptions, reviews, and user data to provide personalized recommendations.
Key Technologies: Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, NLP for Text Analysis, Python, Scikit-Learn.

3. Sentiment Analysis Project
   
Description: This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of text data, such as product reviews or social media posts. The goal is to classify the sentiment expressed in the text as positive, negative, or neutral.
Key Technologies: Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, Python, NLTK, Scikit-Learn.

4. Text Classification Project
   
Description: A comprehensive text classification project that aims to categorize text data into predefined classes. Applications include spam detection, topic categorization, and intent recognition.
Key Technologies: Text Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Machine Learning Algorithms, Python, Scikit-Learn.

5. TF-IDF Document Classification
    
Description: This project involves classifying documents using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique. It demonstrates the use of TF-IDF for feature extraction and classification of textual data.
Key Technologies: TF-IDF, Document Classification, Python, Scikit-Learn.

6. Topic Modelling Project
    
Description: The topic modelling project aims to uncover hidden themes or topics within a collection of documents. It utilizes techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify and categorize topics.
Key Technologies: Topic Modelling, LDA, Text Mining, Python, Gensim.
